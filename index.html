    <p style="color:LimeGreen;">Hi and welcome to my IT profile, my name is Jason Dang
      and my student number is s3781830 and contact email is S3781830@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <img src="Portrait.jpg" alt="My Portrait" width="200" height="300">


    <p><b>A little introduction about myself:</b></p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia however I come from a Vietnamese heritage, my parents immigrated in the early 90s to Australia looking for a better life. At home I speak Vietnamese with my parents as they don’t know much English, over the years this has taught me to be fluent in Vietnamese which I have found quite useful in communicating to other Viet speaking people whether that be at work or overseas. I have lived in West Melbourne my entire life in a suburb called “Brooklyn” which is just under a 20 minute drive to the CBD. I am currently 21 years old and undertaking my final year of my Bachelor’s degree in Business management at RMIT university with a major in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (Applied), in my family I am actually the first person to have gone to Uni, to which I feel both proud and grateful for.</p>

    <p><b>What do I do outside of my studies?</b></p>
    <p>On the days when I’m not studying I work part-time at Supercheap Auto, I have always been interested in cars since I was a child and working there for the last 2-3 years I have received a lot of on-the-job training which has taught me a great amount about the automotive and  retail auto part industry, moreover the experience and knowledge gained has taught me valuable soft skills that I have been applying during Uni and will definitely be useful for my career post graduating.</p>

    <p>Examples of these soft skills include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Being able to contact and communicate with customers, suppliers, distributors, other businesses and internal departments in a professional manner.</li>
      <li>Appreciation and application of teamwork, adaptability and time management in a work environment in order to achieve KPIs and set objectives.</li>
      <li>The qualities of a great leader, a good leader leads by example and isn’t afraid of getting their hands dirty and works together in a team, through effective communication and delegation whilst upholding integrity and respect.</li>
      <li>Conflict resolution is an essential skill in keeping a positive and productive work environment, possible through emotional intelligence, open communication, compromise and agreement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>During my free time, as a passion and side hustle I detail, fix, restore and sell car parts. One of my latest completed projects were a set of discontinued 18 inch rims from RAYS Japan that had some severe damaged around the outer rim, lug holes and spokes. I completed a full alloy repair and respray on each rim, and applied decals and ceramic coating. Below you can view the before and after photos of my work.<p>


    <h3>Interests in IT</h3>

    <p>Information Technology (IT) for myself is an interesting field and topic as there are unlimited and untapped possibilities and use cases, IT has become embedded into society and a part of our daily lives for good reason. Its importance highlights that IT’s development and implementation can be used to solve mundane to very complex problems that we may have and be used to carry out different and specific tasks which ultimately can save us time, effort, resources, and bring us value.</p>

    <p>My interest in this field really sparked when I started to watch Linus Tech Tips back in 2013 and I built my first PC in year 8, I remember meticulously doing my research into build guides, the hardware and components needed to build a decent gaming computer at the time. I bought the parts I needed from Centre Com, assembling and booting the computer up that night, eventually I learned the basics of overclocking the computer and overall it was a very fun and rewarding experience to have built my first computer by myself. As you have read I was really interested in computers at the time and by takings classes such as robotics, systems engineering and business management in high school really brought my attention to the possibilities of using IT within society and in business applications to streamline operations and ultimately bring new unfound value to customers and the business.</P>

    <P>Towards the end of high school I really gained an interest into Logistics and Supply Chain Management, this area is often overlooked by many people as just “truck driving” but in reality there is a lot more that goes into managing a supply chain, and what I have learnt from studying at RMIT is that every single business and organisation relies on a efficient and effective supply chain to be able to successfully operate and turn a profit, without proper logistics and supply chain management there would not be any value in the business and the service or product you are trying to provide if for example you cannot align the right source, at the right quantity, at the right quality, at the right price, at the right time, at the right  place. Logistics and supply chain go hand in hand with information systems and technology in order to facilitate the planning and control of the multitudes of different operations involved within a supply chain, including manufacturing, procurement, warehousing and inventory, and logistical activities to name a few.
    </P>

    <p>When it came time to review my offer letters from the Universities and courses I had applied to after completing VCE, I had the dilemma of choosing between the course I am undertaking now and an IT based course from another high ranking university. I chose RMIT as from my prior research it was one of the only universities that had a renowned course for Logistics and Supply Chain management with strong industry connections, placement opportunities, support for students,  an overall innovative culture, modern facilities, and skilled and experienced teaching staff. In my dilemma I ultimately knew that I would rather be doing a course that I am actually interested in rather than one that my family wanted me to pursue more than I did.</p>

    <p>I am glad to have chose RMIT and have learnt more than I would have expected, so far I have experienced working with real clients that range from entrepreneurs to medium and large organisations on challenging but rewarding projects with diversely skilled fellow students from across the globe. The knowledge and experiences gained are invaluable to me and I will carry this on into my future career.</p>
