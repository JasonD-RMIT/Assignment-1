    <p style="color:LimeGreen;">Hi and welcome to my IT profile, my name is Jason Dang
      and my student number is s3781830 and contact email is S3781830@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p><b>A little introduction about myself:</b> I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia however I come from a Vietnamese heritage, my parents immigrated in the early 90s to Australia looking for a better life. At home I speak Vietnamese with my parents as they don’t know much English, over the years this has taught me to be fluent in Vietnamese which I have found quite useful in communicating to other Viet speaking people whether that be at work or overseas. I have lived in West Melbourne my entire life in a suburb called “Brooklyn” which is just under a 20 minute drive to the CBD. I am currently 21 years old and undertaking my final year of my Bachelor’s degree in Business management at RMIT university with a major in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (Applied), in my family I am actually the first person to have gone to Uni, to which I feel both proud and grateful for.</p>

    <p><b>What do I do outside of my studies?</b> On the days when I’m not studying I work part-time at Supercheap Auto, I have always been interested in cars since I was a child and working there for the last 2-3 years I have received a lot of on-the-job training which has taught me a great amount about the automotive and  retail auto part industry, moreover the experience and knowledge gained has taught me valuable soft skills that I have been applying during Uni and will definitely be useful for my career post graduating.</p>
