    <p style="color:LimeGreen;">Hi and welcome to my IT profile, my name is Jason Dang
      and my student number is s3781830 and contact email is S3781830@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <img src="Portrait.jpg" alt="My Portrait" width="500" height="333">


    <p><b>A little introduction about myself:</b></p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia however I come from a Vietnamese heritage, my parents immigrated in the early 90s to Australia looking for a better life. At home I speak Vietnamese with my parents as they don’t know much English, over the years this has taught me to be fluent in Vietnamese which I have found quite useful in communicating to other Viet speaking people whether that be at work or overseas. I have lived in West Melbourne my entire life in a suburb called “Brooklyn” which is just under a 20 minute drive to the CBD. I am currently 21 years old and undertaking my final year of my Bachelor’s degree in Business management at RMIT university with a major in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (Applied), in my family I am actually the first person to have gone to Uni, to which I feel both proud and grateful for.</p>

    <p><b>What do I do outside of my studies?</b></p>
    <p>On the days when I’m not studying I work part-time at Supercheap Auto, I have always been interested in cars since I was a child and working there for the last 2-3 years I have received a lot of on-the-job training which has taught me a great amount about the automotive and  retail auto part industry, moreover the experience and knowledge gained has taught me valuable soft skills that I have been applying during Uni and will definitely be useful for my career post graduating.</p>

    <p>Examples of these soft skills include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Being able to contact and communicate with customers, suppliers, distributors, other businesses and internal departments in a professional manner.</li>
      <li>Appreciation and application of teamwork, adaptability and time management in a work environment in order to achieve KPIs and set objectives.</li>
      <li>The qualities of a great leader, a good leader leads by example and isn’t afraid of getting their hands dirty and works together in a team, through effective communication and delegation whilst upholding integrity and respect.</li>
      <li>Conflict resolution is an essential skill in keeping a positive and productive work environment, possible through emotional intelligence, open communication, compromise and agreement.</li>
    </ul>

<p>During my free time, as a passion and side hustle I detail, fix, restore and sell car parts. One of my latest completed projects were a set of discontinued 18 inch rims from RAYS Japan that had some severe damaged around the outer rim, lug holes and spokes. I completed a full alloy repair and respray on each rim, and applied decals and ceramic coating. Below you can view the before and after photos of my work.<p>
